Ubuntu â€“ Bluetooth not finding any devices ( Ubuntu 18.04 )
18.04bluetooth

Bluetooth not finding any devices in Ubuntu 18.04. I tried different solutions that were found on the internet but with no success.

After Bluetooth is enabled, it keeps searching for devices until it is turned off. All the devices that I am trying to connect with are fully functional, they were paired with other OS and working fine.

In my case the BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd was missing. Try this command dmesg | grep -i 'blue' there if you find Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: patch brcm/BCM43142A0-0a5c-216c.hcd not found then you have same problem.

Download the BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd file from this github repo.

After that perform

sudo cp BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM43142A0-0a5c-21d7.hcd

sudo modprobe -r btusb

sudo modprobe btusb
